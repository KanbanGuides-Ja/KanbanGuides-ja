# Open Guide to KaThThe motivation wasn't to add more rules or make Kanban heavier. Quite the opposite: it was to clarify the spirit of Kanban, especially around flow, continuous improvement, and collaborative delivery. Kanban has always been about enabling teams to optimize flow, reduce waste, and deliver value. This guide helps modern teams keep that spirit alive‚Äîespecially in environments shaped by uncertainty, acceleration, and new technology.s guide is a response to those questions. It's not a replacement of existing Kanban literature. It's an open companion‚Äîa way to support people who already use Kanban but feel they need more guidance to navigate today's realities.ban
