# 1\. Glossary

A _translator_ is a person who facilitates, creates, amends, or reviews the translation(s) of documents on the official website(s) for accessing Open Guide to Kanban, currently located at the Open Guide to Kanban website [https://kanbanguides.org](https://kanbanguides.org).

The administrator(s) of the official website(s) for accessing Open Guide to Kanban, currently the Open Guide to Kanban website [https://kanbanguides.org](https://kanbanguides.org), act as the _translation guardian_.

# 2\. General Rules

1. The community owns the translations, not the groups or individuals who perform the translation(s). Therefore, other groups or individuals can take over the translation(s) for subsequent updates without requesting permission from the previous translators, provided they obtain written permission from the translation guardian.
2. The translator must verify that the translation appears as expected in HTML, Markdown, and PDF formats. For images, the translator should use the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format if applicable.
3. Translators are expected to follow the written GitHub processes on the Open Guide to Kanban website.
4. The translation guardian or delegate will publish translations in both markdown/HTML and high-quality PDF formats for electronic distribution (so that hyperlinks work).
5. The translation should render no material changes to content (such as changes in meaning, emphasis, or inattention to nuance); this includes the acknowledgment section.
6. A translation can be presented in side-by-side paragraph format (to enhance reader trust), fully translated, or both (in a single document). If both side-by-side and full translations are in the same document, the side-by-side translation must appear first.
7. Copyright information and creative commons collection or license information in the original document must not be altered and, therefore, should not be translated.
8. The translation must include a _Translator Acknowledgement_ section and a _Change_ _Log,_ as specified in Section 6 of this Code of Conduct. The Translator Acknowledgement section must include details for the current translation version and should consist of previous translator groups, subject to their permission.
9. The translation guardian reserves the right to remove acknowledgments or translations should they determine that the group of translators, or individuals therein, bring the Open Guide to Kanban into disrepute.
10. During translation, reviewers should submit all feedback through constructive and respectful comments to help ensure that it is not ignored or diminished. Alternatively, reviewers can provide audio or video feedback.
11. Translators, like everyone else, are welcome to suggest a change(s) to the Open Guide to Kanban by following the GitHub process on [https://kanbanguides.org](https://kanbanguides.org).
12. One translation per language is preferred. There are some acceptable exceptions due to regional differences.
13. A translator who, in the eyes of the translation guardian, demonstrates a breach of openness, transparency, trust, humility, courage, focus, commitment, or respect will receive a private written warning from the translation guardian.
14. A translator who, in the eyes of the translation guardian, for the 2nd or 3rd time, demonstrates a breach of openness, transparency, trust, humility, courage, focus, commitment, or respect, will receive a public written warning from the translation guardian. There is no appeals process.
15. The translation guardian reserves the right to remove translators who, in the eyes of the translation guardian, demonstrate four times (or more) a breach of openness, transparency, trust, humility, courage, focus, commitment, or respect . There is no appeals process.

| (optional) **Social media handles:**        |     |

5. It is permitted to use AI as an aid to translation, but the final translation must have been reviewed and corrected by at least five human reviewers whose mother tongue is the language of the translation.
6. Provide written/audio/video responses from a minimum of five translation reviewers whose first language is the same as the language of translation. Ideally, three reviewers will have Kanban knowledge, and two will not.

# 5\. Reserved Words

Some terms are challenging to translate into other languages, yet readers must understand them. The words in the table below are reserved words. Also, the labels for all Open Guide to Kanban conventions, measures, metrics, and prioritization techniques are reserved words, e.g, Buffer, Random, Validated Value.

Given the above, translation is allowed for any instance of the terms below. The American English term must appear in parentheses following the first instance of each translated term. Subsequently, the term may appear in the translated language. The translator may use the American English term throughout if that is the best option.

If the translation of a reserved word/expression is awkward in the translated language, the translator should consult with the translation guardian. Including a glossary at the end of a translated document might be beneficial to readers.

For example, AI translation in French (France):  
Le concept de flux(Flow) est au cœur de la compréhension de Kanban.

The references section must not be translated; video, article, paper, and book titles are as they are.

For example:

Kanban University (2021) The Official Guide to The Kanban Method \[Online\]. Available at: [https://kanban.university/new-to-kanban-get-the-official-guide-to-the-kanban-method/](https://kanban.university/new-to-kanban-get-the-official-guide-to-the-kanban-method/) (Accessed: 29 June 2025).
